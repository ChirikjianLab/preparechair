## Abstract
In this letter, a paradigm for the classification and manipulation of previously unseen objects is established and demonstrated through a real example of chairs. We present a novel robot manipulation method, guided by the understanding of object stability, perceptibility, and affordance, which allows the robot to prepare previously unseen and randomly oriented chairs for a teddy bear to sit on. Specifically, the robot encounters an unknown object and first reconstructs a complete 3D model from perceptual data via active and autonomous manipulation. By inserting this model into a physical simulator (*i.e.*, the robot's "imagination"), the robot assesses whether the object is a chair and determines how to reorient it properly to be used, *i.e.*, how to reorient it to an upright and accessible pose. If the object is classified as a chair, the robot reorients the object to this pose and seat the teddy bear onto the chair. The teddy bear is a proxy for an elderly person, hospital patient, or child. Experiment results show that our method achieves a high success rate on the real robot task of chair preparation. Also, it outperforms several baseline methods on the task of upright pose prediction for chairs.
